# Overview

In this tutorial, we covered how to develop and test a GraphQL API with FastAPI, Orator ORM, and pytest.

We looked at how to wire up Orator ORM and Postgres along with FastAPI and GraphQL via Graphene. We also covered how to create GraphQL Schemas, Queries, and Mutations. Finally, we tested our GraphQL API with pytest.
